## 18.05.2026 — v1.6.1 — Phase 5 patch: drop list silent apply + accept-time fuzzy dedup

Two fixes on top of the Phase 5 PR after live testing surfaced edge cases:

- **Background list silent-apply removed.** `apply-suggestions.ts` no
  longer touches `list_places`. `suggested_lists` stays on the persisted
  `place_profile` for downstream use (search, future ranking) but is not
  acted on after save. The Add Place dialog (Phase 3 lite chips) is the
  only path that assigns places to lists from AI — opt-in by design.
  Rationale: LLM is strict (taxonomy), user intent is loose (geography).
  Silent-applying in the background contradicts whichever signal the user
  gave at save time. Documented in [[05-flows/full-profile-flow#why-no-list-silent-apply]].
- **Accept-time fuzzy dedup.** `POST /api/user/ai-suggestions/[id]/accept`
  was using exact `ilike` against the tag name. If the user manually
  created a near-match tag (e.g. `"Speakeasy"`) **after** the queue row
  was written, the LLM's later proposal (e.g. `"Speakeasy Vibe"`) would
  bypass dedup and create a duplicate. The accept handler now runs
  `isFuzzyMatch` over the user's full tag list (and over the parent's
  sub-categories for the subcategory branch) before deciding whether to
  insert. Match → reuse existing entity; no match → create new.
- Helper return shape: `applyProfileSuggestions` no longer returns
  `listsApplied`. The `step=profile` enrich route log line was updated to
  drop that field.

## 14.05.2026 — v1.6.0 — AI Phase 5: Moderation Queue UI

The Phase 4 background pipeline has been silently writing proposals to
`ai_suggestions_queue` since merge. This phase closes the loop with the
**human-in-the-loop UI**: Settings → AI tab now lists pending tag and
sub-category proposals with accept/reject controls, and a live count
badge on the tab itself surfaces backlog at a glance.

- **API routes**:
  - `GET /api/user/ai-suggestions` — lists pending proposals, pre-aggregated
    server-side by `(type, lower(value), parent_category_id)` so the same
    concept proposed by multiple places renders as one row with
    `occurrences` count. Joined with `places(name)` and `categories(name)`
    for UI context (sample place name, parent category label).
  - `POST /api/user/ai-suggestions/[id]/accept` — creates the entity
    (reuses if user already has one with that name/slug to avoid dupes),
    attaches it to every queued place (tag → `place_tags` insert with
    dedupe; sub-cat → `places.subcategory_id` update), and marks all
    sibling queue rows `status='accepted'`. Idempotent: second accept
    returns 409 `Already accepted`.
  - `POST /api/user/ai-suggestions/[id]/reject` — flips siblings to
    `status='rejected'`. Vocabulary untouched.
- **`useAiSuggestions` hook** — `useAiSuggestions` + `useAcceptAiSuggestion`
  + `useRejectAiSuggestion`. Mutations invalidate `["ai-suggestions"]`
  plus `["tags"]` / `["subcategories"]` / `["places"]` on accept so all
  consuming UIs refresh.
- **`AiSuggestionsQueue` component** — lives under the AI tab below the
  master toggle. Hidden when AI is disabled or unavailable. Empty-state
  copy explains where suggestions come from. Two grouped sections (Tags,
  Sub-categories) with per-row Accept (emerald button) + Reject (× icon)
  controls, in-flight loading states, and toast feedback. Each row shows
  the proposed value, parent (for sub-cats), the sample place that
  triggered it, occurrence count, and confidence percentage.
- **`AiTabTrigger`** — live count badge on the AI tab in Settings.
  Wraps `useAiSuggestions`; renders an emerald pill with the number when
  > 0. Single source of truth for the moderation backlog indicator.
- **Vault**:
  - [[02-backend/api-routes/user]] bumped to v1.1.0 with the 5 new endpoints
    documented (settings + suggestions group).
  - [[03-frontend/hooks/use-ai-suggestions]] (new).

---

## 14.05.2026 — v1.5.0 — AI Phase 4: Full Profile (first real LLM call)

**The big one.** First end-to-end Gemini Flash call in production: place is
saved → reviews land → background pipeline triggers `step=profile` → a
structured `PlaceProfile` (TLDR + pros/cons + theme insights + refined
features) gets persisted to `places.google_data.place_profile`. The place
detail page polls for it and renders the AI Summary card. Tag / list /
sub-category suggestions auto-apply where they match user entities; new
proposals queue for moderation (Phase 5 UI).

- **DB migration** `create_ai_suggestions_queue_table` — per-user moderation
  queue with type='tag'|'subcategory', confidence, status, partial UNIQUE
  index for case-insensitive dedup per pending row.
- **New extractors / prompt** (`src/lib/ai/`):
  - `prompts/place-profile-full.ts` — system+user prompt builder. Bakes user
    context (tags, categories, subcategories, lists, cities) inline and lists
    sub-cat slugs per parent so the LLM picks from the right vocabulary.
    Translates non-English reviews. 50-review window, 400-char-per-review cap.
  - `apply-suggestions.ts` — 3-band auto-apply policy. matched_existing
    tags/lists silent-apply (place_tags / list_places INSERT). new_proposals
    run through Phase 1's fuzzy dedup; rerouted ones silent-apply, true new
    ones queue. Sub-category: silent apply on existing match at conf ≥ 0.85;
    queue new proposal at conf ≥ 0.9.
- **`/api/places/[id]/enrich?step=profile`** — new branch in the existing
  enrich route. AI-features-gated, AI-key-gated, no-reviews-gated. Calls
  `generateText({ model: google('gemini-flash-latest'), output: Output.object({ schema: PlaceProfileSchema }) })`
  and persists the typed result. Tracks usage as SKU `ai_place_profile`
  (~$1/1k calls baseline). Force-stamps `completeness='full'`, `model_version`,
  `source_review_count` after the call to override anything the LLM gets wrong
  on meta fields.
- **Pipeline chain** — `step=reviews` now fires `step=profile`
  fire-and-forget at the end (gated by `ai_features_enabled`). Cookies are
  forwarded so the chained request runs as the user.
- **`AiSummaryCard`** — new client component in `src/components/places/`:
  - Skeleton state while waiting (`reviewsAvailable` AND
    `completeness !== 'full'`).
  - Full state: TLDR + 2-column highlights/cons + theme-insights pills
    (sentiment emoji + count + click-to-expand evidence quote) +
    distinctive feature pills.
  - Refresh button calls `step=profile` manually.
- **Place detail page** — new polling effect: 5s interval while
  `hasReviews && !isFullProfile`, capped at 2 minutes. Card slots in
  before the Amenities section.
- **Types** — `GooglePlaceData.place_profile?: Record<string, unknown>`
  (loosely typed in shared types; consumers cast to `PlaceProfile` from
  the Zod schema).
- **Vault**:
  - [[02-backend/schema/ai_suggestions_queue]] (new).
  - [[05-flows/full-profile-flow]] (new) — end-to-end including 3-band
    auto-apply matrix, failure modes, manual refresh, open questions.
- **Post-merge patches on the same PR**:
  - **Address-aware list matching**: `matchListsFromProfile` (Phase 3 lite
    path) now also tokenizes the place's `address` string on `, / \` and
    probes each segment against list names. Fixes the "Istanbul Cafes"
    list not matching when DataForSEO returns `city = "Kadıköy"` (the
    metropolitan city only appeared in the address). Short tokens (< 3
    chars) and house-number prefixes are stripped.
  - **AI Summary skeleton state Generate button**: pre-Phase-4 places
    have reviews but no auto-trigger ever fired for them. The skeleton
    state's refresh button (previously full-state only) is now visible
    in both states with copy "generate" (skeleton) / "refresh" (full).
    Gives users a manual escape hatch for older places + transient
    background failures.

## 14.05.2026 — v1.4.0 — AI Phase 3: Lite Profile in parse-link

First **user-visible AI surface**: paste a Google Maps URL into Add Place →
"✨ AI Suggestions" panel materializes instantly with tag/list chips and the
matching sub-category gets pre-selected when confidence is high. **Still
zero LLM calls** — all rule-based extraction off DataForSEO + Google types.

- **`src/lib/ai/extract/`** new directory:
  - `category-resolver.ts` — Google types → `(primary, sub_category, confidence)` via strict + loose mapping tables. Detects hybrid venues (restaurant + bar → `secondary_role`). Confidence: strict 0.95, loose 0.75, name-heuristic 0.7, no match 0.
  - `features-extractor.ts` — DataForSEO `attributes` + `price_level` + `total_photos` + `is_claimed` → `features` slice (cuisine/dietary/seating/distinctive/price_range). LLM-only fields (atmosphere/occasions/music/crowd) left empty.
  - `suggestions-from-profile.ts` — `matchTagsFromFeatures` (fuzzy match cuisines/dietary/distinctive against user tags) + `matchListsFromProfile` (city/country/category/cuisine match against user list names). Lite path emits matched_existing only; no new tag proposals (Phase 4 territory).
  - `lite-profile.ts` — top-level orchestrator returning a `lite` `PlaceProfile`.
- **`/api/places/parse-link` route** — appends `lite_profile` to both Google and DataForSEO response paths. New helper `buildLiteProfileForResponse` fetches `ai_features_enabled` + user's tags + lists, builds the profile, returns null on errors (fail-soft). Adds ~100ms to a ~3-4s parse.
- **`/api/places` POST + `useCreatePlace`** — accept `subcategory_id`. Phase 2's table now has a write path from the Add dialog.
- **`AddPlaceDialog`** — new "✨ AI Suggestions" panel: tag chips + list chips (opt-in, user clicks). Sub-category strip under the Category dropdown shows all parent sub-cats with a Sparkles icon on the AI-suggested one. Auto-pre-select sub-cat when confidence ≥ 0.85. Reset clears AI state too.
- **Auto-apply policy in dialog**: tag/list chips stay opt-in (user is right there); sub-category auto-selects on high confidence (one click deep behind a dropdown, removes friction). Per the 3-band design discussed before Phase 3.
- **Noise control — `SUPPRESSED_FROM_SUGGESTIONS`** (post-merge patch on top of the same PR): lite path now drops too-common attributes (`wifi`, `parking`, `reservations`, `photogenic`, `unclaimed`, `indoor`, `outdoor`, price-level strings) from tag-suggestion candidates. `features.*` keeps them in full; only the chip rail is filtered. Phase 4 LLM proposals will run through the same filter as a safety net. Rationale + Phase 4 fallback role documented in [[05-flows/lite-profile-flow#noise-control--suppressed_from_suggestions]].
- **Vault**: new [[05-flows/lite-profile-flow]] + parse-link section updated.

## 14.05.2026 — v1.3.0 — AI Phase 2: Subcategory infrastructure

Per-user subcategory table (under each parent category) + default
dictionary + filter cascade UI + Settings manage UI. **No AI behavior yet**
— Phase 4 will start populating subcategories via the AI place profile.

- **DB migrations**:
  - `create_subcategories_table` — per-user table with RLS (`auth.uid() = user_id`).
  - `add_subcategory_id_to_places` — nullable FK with `ON DELETE SET NULL`.
  - `create_seed_default_subcategories_function` — idempotent helper.
  - `create_subcategories_signup_trigger` — `z_on_profile_created_default_subcategories` (AFTER trigger order verified via `information_schema.triggers.action_order`).
  - `backfill_subcategories_for_existing_users` — 3 existing users seeded (62 sub-cats each).
- **Default dictionary** (62 entries across 11 of 12 parents) is encoded inside `seed_default_subcategories_for_user()`.
- **TypeScript**: `Subcategory` interface + `Place.subcategory_id` + `PlaceFilters.subcategory_ids`.
- **React Query hook** `useSubcategories` (+ `useCreateSubcategory`, `useDeleteSubcategory`).
- **API routes**:
  - `GET /api/subcategories` (with `?include_pending=true`).
  - `POST /api/subcategories` (Zod-validated, 409 on dup).
  - `PATCH /api/subcategories/[id]` (rename + approve pending).
  - `DELETE /api/subcategories/[id]` (cascades to places via SET NULL).
- **`GET /api/places`** — new `?subcategory=<id,id>` query param + joined `subcategory:subcategories(*)` select.
- **`useFilters`** — `subcategory_ids` URL state (`?subcategory=…`).
- **`CategoryFilter`** — cascade UI: when a parent is selected, sub-cat pills appear under it with parent-name labels.
- **Settings → Categories**: each row is now collapsible with `ChevronRight`. Expanded view shows child sub-cats + add/delete form. Default sub-cats can be deleted (places fall back to parent only).
- **Vault**: [[02-backend/schema/subcategories]], [[02-backend/api-routes/subcategories]], [[03-frontend/hooks/use-subcategories]] new docs.

## 14.05.2026 — v1.2.0 — AI Phase 1: foundation

Foundation layer for AI features (AI-01 NL filter, AI-03 categorization, AI-04 tag/list suggestions, AI-05 place profile pivot). No user-facing AI behavior yet — this PR only lays the rails.

- **DB migration** `add_ai_features_enabled_to_profiles` — new `profiles.ai_features_enabled boolean NOT NULL DEFAULT true` column. Master toggle for every AI feature.
- **`src/lib/ai/`** new directory:
  - `client.ts` — Gemini factory (`getAiClient()`, `FLASH_MODEL`, `MODEL_VERSION`, `isAiAvailable()`). Uses `@ai-sdk/google` v3 (already in `package.json`).
  - `normalize.ts` — string normalize + Levenshtein + fuzzy-match predicate (`isFuzzyMatch`).
  - `dedup.ts` — `dedupProposals()`: post-LLM fuzzy dedup against existing user entities. Tag/category/list duplication shield.
  - `track-usage.ts` — `trackAiUsage()` + AI_SKU_CONFIG (ai_parse_query, ai_rank_results, ai_place_profile, ai_embedding). Reuses existing `increment_api_usage` RPC.
  - `context-builder.ts` — `buildUserContext()` + `serializeUserContext()`. Built once per AI request; injected into every prompt.
  - `schemas/place-profile.ts` — `PlaceProfileSchema` (lite + full completeness, category_signals, features, theme_insights, searchable_summary).
  - `schemas/parse-query.ts` — `ParseQuerySchema` (hard filters + soft features + semantic_intent + needs_clarification).
  - `schemas/suggestions.ts` — `SuggestionsSchema` (chip UI slice).
- **`/api/user/ai-settings` route** — GET returns `{ enabled, available }`. PUT accepts `{ enabled }`. Zod-validated.
- **Settings → AI tab** — new tab with master toggle. Optimistic update, rollback on error. Surfaces `available: false` state when `GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY` env is missing.
- **`.env.local.example`** — `GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY=` added.
- **Vault**: [[06-ops/env-vars]] bumped to v1.2.0 with the new variable + canonical-list entry.

Phases 2-7 (subcategory infra, lite profile in parse-link, full profile pipeline, suggestions queue, AI-01 NL filtering, backfill) will land as separate PRs.

## 13.05.2026 — v1.1.3 — patch: search-save reviews loading loop

Places saved via the `/map` search box stayed in "Loading reviews..." forever on `/places/[id]` — polling was triggered (`google_data.cid` was set) but reviews never landed.

- `SearchResultPanel` now mirrors `AddPlaceDialog`'s two-step enrichment: await `step=info`, then fire-and-forget `step=reviews` using the CID from the info response (falls back to `_extended.cid`). The await acts as a DB roundtrip guarantee, eliminating the race against POST `/api/places`'s async photo-download UPDATE.
- Falls back to invalidating the `["places"]` cache when `step=info` itself errors (e.g. mapbox-only path with no `google_place_id`).

Extra cost: 1 DataForSEO `business_info_live` call per save (~$0.0054), matching the URL-paste flow.

---

## 13.05.2026 — v1.1.2 — patch: extract CID from FTid + prefer POI coords

Short-link shares (`maps.app.goo.gl/...`) resolve to URLs whose `data=` blob carries an FTid (`!1s0xCELL:0xCID`) and the POI's actual coordinates (`!3d!4d`), but the parser was throwing both away and falling back to text search with the viewport center.

- `src/lib/google/parse-maps-url.ts`:
  - When an FTid is present, the second hex is converted to a Google CID — parser now returns `type: "cid"` with the decimal CID. DataForSEO accepts this as an exact-match key, bypassing the lossy text-search path entirely.
  - `extractCoordinates` now prefers `!3d!4d` (POI actual location) over `@lat,lng` (viewport center). The two can differ by 1+ km in real-world shares.
  - `ParsedUrl` now exposes the resolved URL via `resolvedUrl?: string` for any future re-inspection.
- `/api/places/parse-link`: handles the new `type: "cid"` branch — issues `keyword: "cid:<decimal>"` straight to DataForSEO.

Real-world impact: e.g. `https://maps.app.goo.gl/m6rXiaYaKLqEdqhh6` (Top Cuvée Highbury) used to 404 with "Could not find place details" because viewport center sat 1.3 km from the actual POI and "Top Cuvée Highbury" + 2 km bias still missed Google's text-search match. Now it resolves via CID on the first call.

---

## 13.05.2026 — v1.1.1 — patch: short-query parse-link match

Fixes "Could not find place details" for `/maps/place/Name/@lat,lng/` URLs where the parser only extracts a bare short name (e.g. `Beam`). Short generic keywords lose Google's text-search against same-named businesses worldwide even with a coordinate bias.

- `src/lib/mapbox/search-box.ts`: new exported `reverseGeocode({lng, lat})` helper wrapping Mapbox Search Box `/reverse`. Per-request endpoint, $1.70/1k, 50k/month free.
- `/api/places/parse-link`: when the parser yields `type: "search"` + coordinates, the route now reverse-geocodes once to fetch a `full_address` and appends it to the DataForSEO keyword (`"Beam, Stoke Newington Rd, London, UK"`). Search radius for this branch widened from 1000m → 2000m.
- Same trick already in `/api/search/retrieve/[id]`'s DataForSEO enrichment (v1.0 of F-01) — applied symmetrically here.

---

## 13.05.2026 — v1.1.0 — F-01 place search (Mapbox Search Box)

Shipped F-01 from `_archive/feature-suggestions_v3` (Manuel Mekan Ekleme, drop-pin scope dropped). Users can now search a place on `/map`, preview enriched details, and save to their places without leaving the page.

### Code

- **DB** — migration `add_source_check_with_mapbox_search` applied: `places.source` now has `CHECK (source IN ('manual','import','link','mapbox_search'))`.
- **Backend** — new `GET /api/search/suggest` and `GET /api/search/retrieve/[id]` (`src/app/api/search/...`) wrapping Mapbox Search Box. Retrieve auto-enriches via DataForSEO when env credentials present, mirroring the parse-link response shape.
- **Library** — `src/lib/mapbox/search-box.ts` (server-only): `suggest` + `retrieve` fetch wrappers.
- **Cost tracking** — new SKU `mapbox_search_session` ($11.50/1k, 500 free/month). Tracked on `retrieve` call.
- **Env** — new server-only `MAPBOX_SERVER_TOKEN` (URL-restriction off). Falls back to public token. Added to `.env.local.example`.
- **Types** — `Place.source` extended with `"mapbox_search"`.
- **Frontend hook** — `src/lib/hooks/use-place-search.ts` (`usePlaceSearch`): 300ms debounced suggest, UUIDv4 session token rotation (on retrieve / 180s idle / 50 suggests), retrieve mutation.
- **MapView extension** — new ref methods `flyToCoords({lng,lat,zoom})` and `getCenter()`; new prop `searchMarker?: {lng,lat,color?}` renders a transient `mapboxgl.Marker`.
- **New components** — `src/components/map/search-box.tsx` (overlay autocomplete pill) and `src/components/map/search-result-panel.tsx` (slide-in detail + Save form). Form reuses existing inline-category/list/tag creators and VisitStatusToggle.
- **MapContent integration** — search box sits beside the mobile filter button (top-left); search panel hides FAB / visible-place badge / empty-state CTA. Selecting a place closes any active search panel and vice versa.

### Docs

- New [[02-backend/api-routes/search]] — full per-route detail.
- New [[03-frontend/hooks/use-place-search]] — hook spec + session lifecycle.
- New [[05-flows/place-search-flow]] — end-to-end flow doc.
- Updated [[02-backend/api-routes/_README]] — added Search group.

### Out of scope (deferred)

- Drop-pin / map-click to add place.
- Clickable POI labels (Mapbox Standard `addInteraction` or `queryRenderedFeatures` overlay).
- Proximity bias (`usePlaceSearch` accepts the opt; not wired through `SearchBox` yet).
- Per-user DataForSEO billing (server env still single-tenant).

- Confirmed via Supabase MCP `execute_sql`: the `get_visit_status_counts` RPC the stats route attempts to call **does not exist** — fallback path is the active one.

## 12.05.2026 — v0.2.0 — Overview + domain anchor layer

- Wrote [[00-overview/system-overview]] — architecture diagram, subsystem map, cross-cutting concerns, known sharp edges. Built from a Supabase MCP live inspection + archived v2 docs + source-file reads.
- Wrote [[00-overview/tech-stack]] — dep-by-dep breakdown with versions, roles, and the "not in stack" list.
- Wrote [[00-overview/repo-structure]] — full folder map for `src/`, `public/`, `.claude/`, `.github/`, and counts.
- Wrote [[00-overview/glossary]] — domain entities, subsystems, geo terms, auth/security terms, frontend/state terms.
- Wrote `01-domain/`:
  - [[01-domain/places]] — Place entity with full column shape, `google_data` jsonb breakdown, lifecycle, every `/api/places/*` route, cascade-delete behavior.
  - [[01-domain/trips]] — covers `trips` + `trip_days` + `trip_day_places`, auto-plan algorithm, Mapbox Directions cost model.
  - [[01-domain/lists]] — List entity + `list_places` junction, reorder transaction note.
  - [[01-domain/sharing]] — Shared Link with public-vs-service-role policy split, save-to-account viral loop.
  - [[01-domain/users-and-profiles]] — Profile shape, signup trigger cascade (`handle_new_user` → `create_default_categories`), encrypted API keys, `api_usage` RPC.
  - [[01-domain/categories-and-tags]] — 12 default categories with verified colors/icons (from `create_default_categories()` source), tag M:N junction.
  - [[01-domain/geo-and-s2]] — PostGIS wire formats, `parsePostgisPoint` parser, S2 FTid decode fallback, `(0,0)` sentinel.

## 12.05.2026 — v0.1.0 — Vault scaffolded

- Created folder skeleton: `_agent/`, `_meta/`, `_archive/`, `00-overview/`, `01-domain/`, `02-backend/`, `03-frontend/`, `04-integrations/`, `05-flows/`, `06-ops/`.
- Moved root `design-system/map-organiser/MASTER.md` → `docs/03-frontend/design-system/master.md`. Removed empty root `design-system/`.
- Archived existing top-level docs (v1/v2 of system, system-design, design-system, feature-suggestions, test-plan + dataforseo analysis) under `_archive/`. Content will be redistributed into the new structure in a later pass.
- Wrote vault foundation:
  - [[README]]
  - [[_meta/vault-guide]]
  - [[_meta/frontmatter-schema]]
  - Templates in `_meta/templates/`
  - [[_agent/conventions]]
  - [[_agent/common-tasks]]
  - [[_agent/pitfalls]]
  - [[_agent/claude-md-source]]
  - [[_archive/_README]]
